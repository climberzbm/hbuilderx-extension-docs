# HBuilderX Windows startup troubleshooting guide

## Summary

This document is `windows` platform solution，Mac please refer to:[mac solution](http://hx.dcloud.net.cn/Tutorial/install/macosx?id=启动问题)
  
The `zip` package of `windows` takes a long time to decompress, please do not interrupt! If the decompression is interrupted, please decompress again.

** HBuilderX cannot startup on Windows, maybe two reasons: **

- New installation，please see `Chapter 1`.
- If HBuilderX can startup before, but it can’t startup now, the configuration file should be damaged, please see `Chapter 4.1`.


## 1.  The latest downloaded HBuilderX cannot be startuped
-------------------------------

> The latest downloaded HBuilderX could not be startuped on Windows System after being decompressed, it did not respond evenif you click it, and the xxx.dll error was reported when it startuped.

`Note：HBuilderX requires the minimum Windows version to be win7, and does not support xp`.

Note：If your computer has an AMD graphics card, please see Chapter 6.

### 1.0 Wrong way to open

Someone download zip package from `DCloud.io`, double click `HBuilderX.exe` directly from decompress software.

`zip package needs to be decompressed before it can be used`.

### 1.1 Shortcuts problems

On Windows, clicking exe file and HBuilderX cannot be startuped if you drag `HBuilderX.exe` to desktop from decompressed zip folder.

How to setup `Desktop shortcut`: 

1. Select `HBuilderX.exe`, click the right mouse button, and a menu appears
2. Click on the menu item: `Send to`
3. Click on `Desktop (Create Shortcut)`


### 1.2. Nothing happens

- After unzipping, click HBuilderX.exe, nothing happens.
- After decompression, click HBuilderX.exe, the HBuilderX process starts and then closes immediately.

**Try the following solutions**

1. After closing all the `anti-virus software`, try again.
2. Use `super administrator` role to try again.
3. Follow solution 1 to try again.
4. Select `HBuilderX.exe`, right-click and click Properties. Operate as shown in the figure below:

### 1.3 Memory cannot be read

> If you encounter the problem of `memory cannot be read`, please search related methods on google.


## 2. Problems caused by Qt
-------------------------------

> You may encounter the following problems if you installed Qt application in your computer.

### 2.1 Problem 1: qt* library is missing

- After decompression, click HBuilderX.exe, it prompts that `qt5*.dll` library is missing.
- After decompression, click HBuilderX.exe, it prompts `Cannot locate xxxxxxx on library xxx.dll`.

Method 3: Check if `qt` is installed on your computer, please remove qt environment variables if it has been installed before.
