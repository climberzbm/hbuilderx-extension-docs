## Goto Definition@goto-definition

Goto definition is an important part of what makes an editor useful. 

HBuilderX has a powerful syntax analysis engine that can accurately jump to the defined position.

The shortcut key to go to the definition is `Alt+D`, and the mouse operation is `Alt+left click`.

> Remarks: Support switching [Ctrl+left mouse button] or [Alt+left mouse button] to go to definition (menu [select], [switch to "Alt+Click" for Multi-Cursor] or [switch to "⌘+Click" for Multi-Cursor])

HBuilderX supports multi-result goto definition.

When there are multiple results for goto definition, hovering the mouse with `Alt` key pressed will list all the results. You can jump to the desired result by `mouse selection` or `using the up and down arrow keys`.
