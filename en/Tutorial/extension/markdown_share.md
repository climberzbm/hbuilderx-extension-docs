> Supported from HBuilderX 2.8.7

## 1. Summary

Markdown has an excellent input experience, but it is difficult to share because of the lack of free, stable, and high-speed hosting servers.

[uniCloud](https://unicloud.dcloud.net.cn/) provide free, stable and high-speed hosting servers and CDN.

Since HBuilderX 2.8.7, based on uniCloud, it provides markdown `one-click sharing` function.

You can convert markdown into HTML web pages with uniCloud web hosting services and publish them as online URLs. Then you can send the URL to anyone who wants to share.

At the same time, the pictures involved in markdown will also be automatically uploaded to the CDN of uniCloud.

## 2. How to use

In the `md` file, right-click and select [Share to Weblink], you can find that the "url" will be output from the console.
